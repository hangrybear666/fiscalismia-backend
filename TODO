# Todo List for [Fiscalismia Backend]

## Unfinished Tasks

### High Prio
- Rate limit API requests, currently DDOS is possible.
- Add POST Route for Variable Expenses Staging and think about how to trigger and evaluate ETL process
- Add Supertest for evaluation of this post route and the ETL process
- Add Supertest to test user schema creation on posting new user by comparing tables in supertest schema to tables in private_username schema

### Medium Prio
- Add rate limiting middleware for express, specifically limiting requests to the login auth routes. get routes should be more lenient.

### Low Prio

### Before Deploying
- Rethink public folder storage for production env -> Persistence with backup / HA
- reenable snyk static code analysis & dependency analysis and fix blatant security errors
- - Replace all SQL interpolation code with parameterized queries which automatically sanitize for SQL Injection
