# Todo List for [Fiscalismia Backend]

## Unfinished Tasks

### High Prio
- Rate limit API requests, currently DDOS is possible.

### Medium Prio
- Add corsOptions (check docu) limiting to access from localhost:3001 or the vite build / preview port and the future frontend domain (placeholder)
- Add rate limiting middleware for express, specifically limiting requests to the login auth routes. get routes should be more lenient.
- Add / Enforce http headers to prevent cross site scripting by using e.g. the helmet library with express app

### Low Prio
- Run snyk code analysis to determine attack vectors for postgres in backend

### Before Deploying
- Rethink public folder storage for production env -> Persistence with backup / HA
